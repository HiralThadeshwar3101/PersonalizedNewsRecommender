Airtel\'s new offer comes in the wake of intensifying competition in the telecom sector after Reliance Jio\'s entry last September.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Airtel\'s new scheme, which was announced on Tuesday, the telecom operator said that it would offer 3GB of free 4G data per month until the end of the year to customers who switch to some of its plans from other carriers and to existing customers who upgrade to 4G by February 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nAirtel\'s plan is open for both prepaid and postpaid options.\r\n\r\nThe 12 months offer is available to any customer with a 4G mobile handset that is currently not on the Airtel network. Any customer, including existing Airtel customers, upgrading to a new 4G handset can also avail this offer, Airtel said.\r\n\r\nFor prepaid customers, Airtel offers unlimited calling (both local and STD) to any network and 1 GB of 4G data for Rs. 345. Customers switching to Airtel 4G under the new offer will now get free local and STD calls and 4GB data.\r\n\r\nPostpaid customers with any 4G mobile handset who are not on the Airtel network or upgrading to a new 4G device will now get 3GB free data per month, with all MyPlan Infinity plans.\r\n\r\nHowever, Airtel\'s new offer has sparked concerns that intensifying competition will hit profits and margins in the sector. Commenting on Airtel\'s new free data offer, global brokerage Morgan Stanley said ongoing tariff wars are a big concern. The disruption in the telecom sector is likely to continue because of Jio\'s aggressive entry and the telecom industry is likely to remain challenging, it added.\r\n\r\nAnother global brokerage Citi, commenting on Airtel\'s offer, said that the revenue of telecom companies per unit of data services provided is likely to drop further.\r\n\r\nKotak Securities in a January 2 note had said that \"a combination of negatives in the form of demonetisation and Jio\'s free services is likely to result in fairly dismal 3Q FY17 earnings prints for Bharti and Idea\".\r\n\r\nBharti Airtel and Idea Cellular shares extended losses to a second straight day.

Whether you\'re a long-term fitness buff or just getting started on the path of getting into shape, a fitness tracker is one of the best gadgets one can get. These wrist-worn (generally) devices can not only track human body\'s vital signs like heart rate, but also log fitness-related data such as step count, calories burnt, sleep activity and more. This data can be then used to create personalized fitness goals and diet plans, thus leading to a healthier lifestyle.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to fitness trackers, Fitbit is a name that needs no introduction. The company recently launched two new products - Charge 2 and Flex 2. Of these, the more expensive Charge 2 is an upgrade to the Fitbit Charge HR, which is now almost two years old.\r\n\r\nWe tested the Fitbit Charge 2 for a few days, using it for tracking everything from sleeping patterns to daily walks. So, is the Fitbit Charge 2 and its promise of a healthier lifestyle any good, especially at an asking price of Rs 14,999? Let\'s find out. \r\nDesign and build quality\r\n\r\nFitbit Charge 2 is essentially comprises two components - tracker module and wrist band. The wrist band is made from a flexible elastomer material and comes with a stainless-steel buckle for fastening the Charge 2 around the wrist. The outer side of the band is textured, while the underside is smooth. The wrist band is removable and can be swapped with one of the many designer bands, which have to be purchased separately. Since it\'s sweat proof, the wrist band doesn\'t irritate the skin even when the Charge 2 is worn on the wrist for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nAs for the tracker module itself, its frame is made from stainless steel. On the top rests a slightly curved black glass, under which hides a large (at least as compared to the Charge HR) OLED display. The left and right sides of the frame are chamfered and a navigation button lies on the left, the only button on the Fitbit Charge 2. \r\nFlip the Charge 2 and you see the optical heart rate tracker with two flashing LEDs (one each at the top and bottom of the tracking chip). There are also three charging contacts at the bottom, which work by making contact with the pins on the clip-on charger. Other important components include a 3-axis accelerometer, an altimeter and a vibration motor.\r\n\r\nOverall, we found the design and build quality of the Fitbit Charge 2 to be really good. While the tracker module is quite solid, the wrist band is flexible yet sturdy enough to withstand daily wear and tear.

They can be boiled at temperatures of up to 150 degrees Celsius or frozen to near absolute zero, but still tardigrades - tiny, Muppet-like creatures also known as water bears or moss piglets - just will not die.\r\n\r\nThey have even been found on the outside of the International Space Station, where the lack of pressure would kill a human in minutes at most. The tardigrades found it so pleasant, they decided to settle down, have sex and produce offspring. Now researchers have discovered how they pull off one of their most extraordinary survival techniques.\r\n\r\nDr Thomas Boothby, of North Carolina University, who led the study, said: \"The big takeaway from our study is that tardigrades have evolved unique genes that allow them to survive drying out. In addition, the proteins that these genes encode can be used to protect other biological material like bacteria, yeast, and certain enzymes - from desiccation.\"\r\n\r\nThese proteins have been named TDPs or \'tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins\' in honour of the 1mm-long creatures who evolved to have them. Previously it had been thought that a type of sugar called trehelose, which is found in other organisms including brine shrimp, was the secret behind the tardigrade\'s Lazarus-like ability to return from the dead after being dried out for up to 10 years.\r\n\r\nFollowing the discovery, reported in the journal Molecular Cell, the scientist put the genes into yeast and bacteria, which then gained the same properties as the tardigrades. Dr Boothby said TDPs could be used to protect crops from drought and to preserve medicines without using a refrigerator.\r\n\r\n\"Being able to stabilise sensitive pharmaceuticals in a dry state is very important to me personally,\" he said. \"I grew up in Africa, where lack of refrigeration in remote areas is a huge problem.

Wireless devices in the home consume ever more data, and it is only growing, and congesting the wi-fi network, researchers said.\r\n\r\nThe wireless network developed by researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology in The Netherlands not only has a huge capacity - more than 40 Gigabits per second (Gbit/s) - but also there is no need to share since every device gets its own ray of light.\r\n\r\nThe system is simple and cheap to set up. The wireless data comes from a few central \'light antennas\', for instance mounted on the ceiling, which are able to very precisely direct the rays of light supplied by an optical fibre.\r\n\r\nThe antennas contain a pair of gratings that radiate light rays of different wavelengths at different angles (\'passive diffraction gratings\').\r\n\r\nChanging the light wavelengths also changes the direction of the ray of light. Since a safe infrared wavelength is used that does not reach the vulnerable retina in your eye, this technique is harmless.\r\n\r\nIf you walk around as a user and your smartphone or tablet moves out of the light antenna\'s line of sight, then another light antenna takes over, researchers said.\r\n\r\nThe network tracks the precise location of every wireless device using its radio signal transmitted in the return direction, they said.\r\n\r\nIt is a simple matter to add devices: they are assigned different wavelengths by the same light antenna and so do not have to share capacity.\r\nMoreover, there is no longer any interference from a neighbouring wi-fi network.\r\nCurrent wi-fi uses radio signals with a frequency of 2.5 or five gigahertz.\r\nThe new system uses infrared light with wavelengths of 1,500 nanometres and higher.\r\nThis light has frequencies that are thousands of times higher, some 200 terahertz, which makes the data capacity of the light rays much larger.\r\n\r\nResearchers managed to achieve a speed of 42.8 Gbit/s over a distance of 2.5 metres. Even if you have the very best wi-fi system available, you would not get more than 300 Megabit/s in total, which is some hundred times less than the speed per ray of light achieved by the new system.\r\nThe system has so far used the light rays only to download; uploads are still done using radio signals since in most applications much less capacity is needed for uploading.','Times Of India ','Science','PTI','57717605.jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-21 20:23:00');

You try to provide your baby with the most-healthy food in appropriate portions. However, what you may not realise is, that this food might be lacking in certain essential micronutrients which include iron, zinc, iodine, folate and vitamin A. This can have long term negative impact on your infant\'s cognitive development and immunity. A good way to overcome the deficiencies is by complementing an infant\'s diet with nutrient dense foods or complete foods that are fortified. This ensures that your child will not have any micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) deficiencies.\r\n\r\nWhile introducing solids to an infant, we, as parents, tend to feed the child home cooked meals. It has been observed that infants who are given foods that meet the nutritional requirements of the rest of the household are more likely to have inadequate amounts of micronutrients. Children less than 2 years of age require vitamins and minerals in higher quantities than what is required by adults. For example, per 100 kcal of food, an infant at 6-8 months needs 9 times as much iron and 4 times as much zinc as an adult male.\r\n\r\nMicronutrients, although required in small quantities, act as the building blocks for an infant\'s mental and physical development. Parents want to give their infants as much nutrition as possible and for this, they rely on home cooked food. However, there are times when home cooked food is not enough to provide the baby with all the nutrition. Micronutrients are often overlooked while feeding the child and in such cases, food fortification becomes important. The food cooked in Indian homes are mostly grain and plant based and although they are rich in macronutrients, they lack essential micronutrients like iron, zinc and calcium.\r\n\r\nThe lack of right kind of nutrition may lead to irreversible damage to a child\'s brain development as well as make him more susceptible to illness when he/she grows up to be an adult. This is especially true for infants between 6 and 12 months of age and particularly for iron and zinc. Thus, it is recommended that infant meals should include a variety of food items ensuring adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. This can be done in several ways like improving dietary plans and fortifying the standard food. Nutrient dense foods or complete foods that are fortified is an effective way to address the deficiencies in your child.\r\n\r\nAlthough home cooked food is considered the best for an infant\'s overall growth and development, it might be lacking in certain essential micronutrients, especially iron and zinc.

One is innate (or natural) that we are born with. The second kind is adaptive immunity which develops throughout our lives and the third one is passive or borrowed immunity, something like mother\'s milk for a newborn. Yet, we let our bodies weaken and fall prey to outside threats. Just as we plant more trees and clean our homes to disinfect our surroundings, we need timely vacuuming and replenishing of our inner system too.\r\n\r\nBE ALL AND END ALL\r\nImmunity is everything when it comes to prevention and healing. It is what empowers the body to fight bacteria, pathogens and viruses and also recognise and destroy rogue and cancer cells. \"There is no rocket science attached to a strong immunity.

Yet, don\'t go overboard. \"Over-exercising reduces and weakens immunity. Running marathons and training without the right nutrition and vitamin levels in the body is dangerous for immunity,\" adds Coutinho. Keep your workouts short and powerful. Jumping exercises, walking, yoga, Pilates are fantastic immunity boosters, as are short runs and weight lifting. \"Exercise is the best antioxidant supplement,\" says Hooda.\r\n\r\nEAT RIGHT\r\nHow to balance nutrition? Make sure you make a note of your daily nutrition intake. Protein is a must. Research shows that deficiency of high-quality protein can result in depletion of immune cells. \"A person weighing 60 kg needs at least 40 gm protein per day. Homemade curd is the best bacteria and protein source,\" Hooda says. Get enough vitamin C since it works as a great scavenger in the body, cleaning up all the mess.

A warning against protectionism has appeared in Group of 20 communiques for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nA diplomatic smoothing of the differences would be a relief for investors who are worried about what the Trump administration really has in store.\r\n\r\nBut if the final language of the communique suggests the Trump administration has asserted its views over those of other governments, it would raise big questions about what will happen to the open market policies that underpin the global economy.\r\n\r\n“The G20 will be scoured for any clues as to exactly how the U.S. might be looking to pursue what looks like a more mercantilist agenda on trade policy,” Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said.\r\n\r\nBy the time they meet in the German city of Baden Baden, the G20 central bankers and finance ministers will know whether there has been another political earthquake after the Trump and Brexit upsets, this time in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nOpinion polls have suggested that Dutch nationalist Geert Wilders’ right-wing Freedom Party, which wants to take the Netherlands out of the European Union and stop Muslim immigration, has lost its lead to more mainstream opponents.\r\n\r\nBut polls failed to predict Trump’s victory or Brexit last year and investors are nervous about a Dutch election shock just weeks before voters in France decide whether to make the anti-EU, far-right Marine Le Pen their new president.\r\n\r\n“It will certainly be a big week,” Coulton said.\r\n\r\nFED MEETING TOPS BUSY WEEK FOR CENTRAL BANKS\r\n\r\nAs well as the Fed’s meeting, central banks in four other leading rich economies -- Japan, Britain, Switzerland and Norway -- are all due to deliver their latest decisions on Thursday.\r\n\r\nNone of the them are expected to follow the Fed and tighten monetary conditions. Instead, they are continuing to try to steer their economies back to normality, and in the Bank of England’s case, to offset incipient signs that last June’s vote to leave the EU is starting to weigh on consumer spending.\r\n\r\nYet for all the political upheaval of the last nine months, which began with the British EU referendum, many economies are enjoying their best growth in years.\r\n\r\nEven in the euro zone, confidence is at a six-year high, the services and manufacturing sectors are growing and unemployment is at its lowest since 2009, prompting European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to declare victory over deflation.\r\n\r\nAgainst the backdrop of a world economy that is picking itself up and strong momentum at home, the question for the U.S. Federal Reserve is not whether to raise interest rates on Wednesday but how quickly it should do so again.\r\n\r\nEconomists at AXA Investment Managers said a sharp upgrade of the Fed’s economic growth projections next week could cause investors to price in even more U.S. rate hikes than the three currently expected for 2017.\r\n\r\nFitch’s Coulton said investors should get ready for a different pace of action at the Fed. “We will probably see the second rate hike in three months. It took eight years to get the previous pair of hikes,” he said.\r\n\r\nBut James Pomeroy, global economist at HSBC, said he expects only two Fed rate hikes this year, beginning next week, as core inflation remains below 2 percent, wages grow slowly and emerging economies feel the strain of a stronger dollar which will weigh on global growth.\r\n\r\n“Although at this meeting it’s all very clear that they are going to be raising rates, and the jobs data suggests that the economy is in pretty good health, we think going forward it becomes harder and harder to go it alone and be the only central bank raising rates,” Pomeroy said.','http://www.hindustantimes.com','Business','Reuters  ','_9ffdd140-0639-11e7-b1f1-d4c6cd13dfb1.jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-12 09:19:00');

Did you violate the Karnataka High Court order (restraining Mallaya from transferring and alienating assets) by transferring USD 40 million,\" the bench asked senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan, representing Mallya.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the bench also posed several queries to the consortium of lending banks led by State Bank of India and asked it whether any criminal proceedings have been initiated against Mallya.\r\n\r\n\"Was any security taken at the time of giving the loan? Was the security adequate? If not, then why the loan was advanced without sufficient security. \r\n\r\n\"Is it not a case of misrepresentation with regard to security?,\" the bench asked.\r\n\r\nThe court then asked Mallya as to why he did not disclose the receipt of USD 40 million from London-based company Diageo Plc and subsequent transfer of money to trusts to which his three children were the beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nThe banks have alleged that Mallya concealed the facts and diverted the money to his son Siddharth Mallya and daughters Leanna Mallya and Tanya Mallya in \"flagrant violation\" of the orders passed by the Karnataka High Court. \r\n\r\nAttorney General Mukul Rohatgi and senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the banks, contended that unless Mallya deposits USD 40 million before this court, he does not deserve to be heard and, moreover, he needed to appear personally as the contempt notice has already been issued. \r\n\r\n\"He did not disclose the USD 40 million deal with Diageo to this court. He took the Supreme Court for a ride, cares two hoots for the courts,\" Rohatgi said.\r\n\r\nIn response to the query as to how the orders of the court would be enforced, he said that the government is seeking deportation of Mallya from the UK.\r\n\r\nDivan, who initiated the arguments, referred to various orders passed by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), the High Court and the Supreme Court and said that the DRT has passed a decree in favour of the banks and the amount to be recovered is approximately Rs 9,200 crores.\r\n\r\nAt present the question is to bring USD 40 million back and a direction be issued to this effect, he said, adding \"Mallya must appear in person before this court\". \r\n\r\nThere was a specific order of the High Court that Mallya will not transfer or alienate any movable and immovable assets to any person, he said. \r\n\r\n\"What will happen to remaining amount,\" the bench asked. \r\n\r\nInstead of filing a response to the contempt notice, Mallya has filed an application seeking recall of the notice itself, Divan said, adding \"there should not be any subversion of orders of this court and the high court\".\r\n\r\nDivan also referred to the orders of the apex court and said that Mallya was asked to file an affidavit giving complete details of the assets and despite these directions, he did not disclose receipt and subsequent transfer of USD 40 million to his children.\r\n\r\nThe bench then inquired about the offer made by Mallya that he was willing to pay around Rs 2,090 crore.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing came forward. No down payment has been made,\" Divan said.\r\n\r\nThe bench then asked as to how the decree of the DRT to recover Rs 9,200 crore would be executed.\r\n\r\n\"There are hundreds of creditors against him. I am SBI. Give my money back, I will go home. Our concern is with the Rs 9,200 crore. God knows, how will it get the money back,\" the Attorney General said, adding that Mallya has taken this court for \"a ride\".\r\n\r\nThe bench asked Vaidyanathan, Mallya\'s counsel, about the response on the contempt notice.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer said that an application for recall of the order has been filed and according to him, no contempt is made out and hence, the plea itself can considered as the reply. \r\n\r\n\"Before the contempt order was passed, I had already disclosed about the USD 40 million,\" he said, adding Mallya had also disclosed the assets of his wife and children.\r\n\r\nRegarding the banks\' arguments that Mallya violated the order of the Karnataka High Court, Vaidyanathan said, \"It is rather unusual and extraordinary. If I (Mallya) have violated the orders of the high court, the contempt proceedings should have been launched in high court not in the Supreme Court\". \r\n\r\nRegarding the USD 40 million, Vaidyanathan said it was received in pursuance to the non-competing agreement with Diageo Plc.\r\n\r\nTo this, the bench said, \"As per the order of high court, the moment any property belonged to you, there was an injunction on it. He (Mallya) is faced with a scenario where there is are dues of Rs 6,200 crore public money on him. All properties belonging to you are under the injunction order\". \r\n\r\n\"Why there was so hurry to dispose of that money (USD 40 million)? It comes to your pocket and is transferred very\r\nsoon, within a day,\" the bench asked.\r\n\r\nMallya\'s counsel said the money which came from Diageo belonged to his children and not him.\r\n\r\nThe bench shot back: \"Somebody who is faced with a default of Rs 6,200 crore and suppose if he gets Rs 3,000 crore, he should have given it to repay the dues\". \r\n\r\nVaidyanathan maintained that the USD 40 million was not covered under the injunction order.\r\n\r\n\"Today, will the highest court of this land decide on the alleged contempt of the Karnataka High Court order without being any application for contempt? No specific contempt plea has been filed. My right to appeal against the high court\'s order can\'t be taken away like this.\r\n\r\n\"This man (Mallya) has been made a poster boy of default. Even the worst criminal, like a terrorist, is entitled to avail his rights given under the Constitution,\" he said, adding, \"this case can\'t be treated as a unique case\".\r\n\r\n\"Why this man is being targeted in this manner when his business has suffered a loss. It is not his fault that his business failed.... Why this special treatment? Why my right to appeal is being taken away,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn October last year, the court had rapped Mallya for not making full disclosure of his overseas properties and had asked him to do so within a month.\r\n\r\nThe bench had also pulled up Mallya for not giving details of USD 40 million which he had allegedly received from British firm Diageo in February last year, saying it was of the \"prima facie view\" that proper disclosure as per its earlier order was not made.\r\n\r\nThe banks had on August 29 last year told the Supreme Court that Mallya had deliberately not made full disclosure of his assets including the USD 40 million he received on February 25 from Diageo.','http://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com','Business','PTI','download.jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-12 09:27:00');

Here are five things to know about the plan:\r\n\r\nIt can\'t fully repeal Obamacare\r\n\"Repeal and replace\" has been the refrain of Republicans for years; Trump issued an executive order on the very day he took the oath of office that directed agencies to ease the regulatory burdens it imposed. But a president cannot repeal a law passed by Congress, and Congress can\'t even repeal one of its own laws without the votes.\r\n\r\nTo repeal Obamacare, the Senate needs 60 votes. There are only 52 Republican senators, so the Republicans are instead using a budget process called reconciliation to pass the AHCA. That only takes a 51-vote majority. The catch? Every measure has to have a budgetary impact.\r\n\r\nIt would redefine Medicaid\r\nSome experts believe this could be the biggest overall effect of the AHCA long term if it is passed.\r\n\r\nObamacare required states to expand the Medicaid program — the joint state-federal health insurance plan for the poor, disabled, pregnant women and for some elderly — to cover more people. The Supreme Court ruled that was voluntary and only 30 states, plus Washington, D.C., opted to expand. An estimated 11 million people got health insurance through this expansion, which was 100 percent paid for by the federal government at first before gradually rolling back to 90 percent.\r\n\r\nIt may take away benefits\r\nObamacare lays out 10 \"essential benefits\" that most health insurance policies must cover. They include outpatient care, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health services and addiction treatment, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, laboratory tests, preventive services (including cancer screenings and vaccines) and pediatric services.\r\n\r\nIt will probably make health insurance more expensive\r\nObamacare heavily subsidized insurance premiums. An estimated 85 percent of the 10 million to 12 million people buying individual insurance on the exchanges got a federal subsidy. Plus, it provided help with other costs. The AHCA stops the subsidies, which varied state by state and according to a customer\'s income using a complicated formula. Instead, the AHCA provides a much simpler tax credit of $2,000 to $4,000 per person.\r\n\r\nFewer people will have health insurance\r\nFew dispute that the Obamacare law got more people covered by health insurance - 20 million people more, by most estimates. It was also designed to ensure that this was quality insurance that would actually cover people for their claims. Republicans say they want to expand access to health insurance, which is not quite the same thing as making sure people get covered, and they say they want people to have the choice to choose bare-bones plans if they want to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','http://www.nbcnews.com','Health','MAGGIE FOX','170308-paul-ryan-health-care-mn-1030_23fe3b64cbe720285a36a389e07642a3.nbcnews-ux-320-320.jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-12 09:32:00');

For decades, scientists have wondered why the outer 5 percent of the sun revolves slower than inner regions.

In a thin, 70-kilometer skin at the surface, the rotation rate drops by 2 percent — a result that could be explained by photons carrying angular momentum away from the sun, slowing it down bit by bit. Angular momentum is a property of a rotating body that keeps an object spinning unless another force acts on it — like a spinning ice skater gradually coming to a stop due to friction.

Bressler, Ph.D., interim director of Florida Atlantic University\'s Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences.\r\n\r\nIn the study, \"Potentiation of motor sub-networks for motor control but not working memory: Interaction of dACC and SMA revealed by resting-state directed functional connectivity,\" the researchers used a simple experimental task, having each participant perform a simple motor control behavior (tapping their forefinger to a visual cue) that alternated between behavior and rest. Brain activity was acquired using functional MRI (fMRI), a technique that allows collection of dynamic signals from within the brain when the subject is doing a task as well as when they are at rest.\r\n\r\nUsing relatively complex modeling of fMRI signals, the team studied brain network interactions between two important brain regions: the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), used for control, and the supplementary motor area (SMA), used for motor movements. In their previous studies, the team highlighted the importance of directional network interactions from the dACC to the SMA during simple motor behavior. In the PLoS One paper, they showed a compelling and opposite effect: during the rest periods that alternated between the motor behavior task, network interactions from the SMA to the dACC were now increased.\r\n\r\nAccording to Diwadkar, who co-directs the Brain Imaging Research Division in the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Neurosciences, \"These results suggest that directional interactions from the SMA to the dACC during the rest period may in fact potentiate task-related interactions in the opposite direction.\" He further noted that the studies confirm what has been long suggested and independently demonstrated: that the brain\'s networks are always in a state of potentiation for action, precisely because it is impossible to predict what they will be required to do at any given time. Therefore, it is unlikely that the brain can ever be at true rest.\r\n\r\nThis paper is one of the few attempts to systematically investigate directional interactions between brain networks in the resting state and show how this state might potentiate the opposite direction of the same network task-related processing.\r\n\r\n\"Our findings are compelling because brain networks are in patterns of incessantly complex directional interactions,\" said Diwadkar. \"Directionality is difficult to measure, and our complex analyses show that it is possible to estimate this from fMRI data.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Diwadkar, the team\'s findings reveal aspects not only of normative brain function but may also provide new directions for characterizing disordered network interactions in neuropsychiatric syndromes.

Hamburger Endowed Chair of Child Psychiatry and chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences at Wayne State University; and in schizophrenia with Dr. Jeffrey Stanley, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry.

Comparing cardiovascular disease rates in these patients to disease rates in patients not reporting marijuana use, researchers found marijuana use was associated with a significantly increased risk for stroke, heart failure, coronary artery disease and sudden cardiac death.\r\n\r\nMarijuana use was also linked with a variety of factors known to increase cardiovascular risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking and alcohol use. After researchers adjusted the analysis to account for these factors, marijuana use was independently associated with a 26 percent increase in the risk of stroke and a 10 percent increase in the risk of developing heart failure.\r\n\r\n\"Even when we corrected for known risk factors, we still found a higher rate of both stroke and heart failure in these patients, so that leads us to believe that there is something else going on besides just obesity or diet-related cardiovascular side effects,\" Kalla said. \"More research will be needed to understand the pathophysiology behind this effect.\"\r\n\r\nResearch in cell cultures shows that heart muscle cells have cannabis receptors relevant to contractility, or squeezing ability, suggesting that those receptors might be one mechanism through which marijuana use could affect the cardiovascular system. It is possible that other compounds could be developed to counteract that mechanism and reduce cardiovascular risk, Kalla said.\r\n\r\nBecause the study was based on hospital discharge records, the findings may not be reflective of the general population. The study was also limited by the researchers\' inability to account for quantity or frequency of marijuana use, purpose of use (recreational or medical), or delivery mechanism (smoking or ingestion).\r\n\r\nKalla suggested that the growing trend toward legalization of marijuana could mean that patients and doctors will become more comfortable speaking openly about marijuana use, which could allow for better data collection and further insights into the drug\'s effects and side effects.','https://www.sciencedaily.com','Health','tugolukof ','170309142318_1_540x360.jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-12 09:46:00');

Gander tried selling Overton\'s last year to help the company address its financial problems, but no buyer was found.\r\n\r\nGander said it is closing 32 \"underperforming\" locations in 11 states, including three Minnesota outlets located in Rogers, Mankato and Woodbury. Also closing are Wisconsin stores in Eau Claire and Germantown.\r\n\r\nGander has been discounting all of its online inventory for more than a month, with typical price reductions of 15 to 25 percent.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges facing big-box retailers from online sellers, some creditors believe Gander Mountain can survive in some form.\r\n\r\n\"Gander Mountain is a good company and it has a long legacy,\" said Jens Welin, executive vice president of Starcom Worldwide, a Chicago media agency that was listed as one of Gander Mountain\'s biggest creditors. \"There has been a lot of turbulence in the market with all of the consolidation.

Holiday, which at the time had 10 retail sporting goods stores, bought all of Gander\'s 17 stores and began operating all the locations under the Gander Mountain banner.\r\n\r\nBut as the company expanded, it remained hamstrung by a deal it made to sell its direct-marketing division and some trademark licenses to rival Cabela\'s for $35 million. The deal included an extended noncompete clause that dogged the new Gander Mountain for years, as the retailer was unable to create a website or publish a catalog until 2008.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Pratt and Erickson took the company private after five straight years of financial losses. The investors bought out the stock of minority shareholders for an estimated $25 million to $30 million.\r\n\r\nSince then, the company has expanded significantly into the firearms market, opening gun-themed stores around the country. It also revamped more than half its stores to create a more friendly environment for shoe shoppers.\r\n\r\nIn its bankruptcy filing, Gander Mountain listed liabilities of more than $500 million. Its list of unpaid vendors features some of the biggest gun makers in the U.S., including Sig Sauer, Remington and Smith & Wesson. The largest unsecured creditor is Vista Outdoor Sales, a California footwear and sporting goods manufacturer that is owed more than $15 million.\r\n\r\nGander Mountain has a $30 million loan and revolving credit lines totaling $525 million, but it was not clear how much of the credit line is being used.

Your Social Security benefits aren\'t set in stone, though, and they don\'t just arrive with no thought or action on your part.\r\n\r\nTo collect as much as you can from the program, you\'ll need to be informed. Read this before starting to collect your Social Security benefits.\r\n\r\nFind out how much income to expect from Social Security\r\nYou can find out how much you can expect to receive in retirement from Social Security at the Social Security website. To give you an initial idea, though, the average monthly retirement benefit was recently $1,363, which totals $16,356 per year. If your earnings have been above average, though, you\'ll collect more than that -- up to the maximum monthly Social Security benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age, which was recently $2,687. (That\'s about $32,000 for the whole year.)\r\n\r\nIt\'s important to have a handle on what to expect so that you can factor it into your retirement plan. You need to determine how much income you\'ll need in retirement, how much is likely to come from Social Security, and how you plan to make up the difference -- perhaps via IRAs, a 401(k), dividend-paying stocks, and/or annuity income. If you haven\'t saved much or enough for retirement, the table below shows how much you might accumulate over various periods:\r\n\r\nThink about when to start collecting Social Security benefits\r\nDon\'t assume that you have to start collecting at 65. The normal (or \"full\") retirement age for Social Security was indeed 65 for everyone at one time. It has been increased for many of us, though. For those born in 1937 or earlier, it\'s 65, and for those born in 1960 or later, it\'s 67. For those born between 1937 and 1960, it\'s somewhere in between. Despite that, though, you can start receiving benefits as early as age 62 and as late as age 70.\r\n\r\nWhen you start collecting is tied to how big your checks will be. Start collecting at your full retirement age, and you\'ll receive your full benefits. But for every year beyond your full retirement age that you delay starting to receive benefits, you\'ll increase their value by about 8% -- until age 70. So delaying from age 67 to 70 can leave you with checks about 24% fatter. If your full benefits would have been $2,000 per month, they would grow to $2,480, a lot more. That\'s a difference of $5,760 over a year.\r\n\r\nStart collecting at 62, and your benefits may be up to about 30% smaller. Note, though, that the system is designed so that total benefits received are about the same for those with average life spans -- no matter when they start collecting. Checks that start arriving at age 62 will be considerably smaller, but you\'ll receive many more of them.\r\n\r\nAs you think about when to start collecting, think about whether you\'re likely to lead a life that\'s above average or below average in length -- as well as when you expect to really need the income.\r\n\r\nIncrease your Social Security benefits, if you can\r\nThe ultimate size of your benefit checks is not tied just to when you start collecting. The formula that the Social Security Administration uses to compute your benefits is based on your earnings in the 35 years in which you earned the most. If you only earned income in 26 years, the formula will be incorporating nine zeros, which will shrink your benefits considerably.\r\n\r\nAre you planning to retire after 32 years of work? It might be worth it to work three more years in order to increase your benefits. Even if you\'ve worked 35 years, if you\'re now earning much more than you have in the past (on an inflation-adjusted basis), you might consider working for another year or two, as each high-earning year will kick a low-earning year out of the calculation.\r\n\r\nConsider spousal strategies\r\nIf you\'re married, you have more options when it comes to collecting Social Security benefits than single individuals do. A couple might claim one spouse\'s benefits early, on time, or late, and do something else with the benefits of the other spouse. Spouses can collect \"spousal benefits\" based on their partner\'s earnings history, too -- getting up to 50% of his or her benefits. (Widows and widowers can choose to start receiving 100% of their late spouse\'s benefit instead of their own, as well.)\r\n\r\nOne effective strategy for many married couples is to start collecting the benefits of the spouse with the lower lifetime earnings record on time or early, while delaying starting to collect the benefits of the higher-earning spouse. That way, the couple gets some income earlier. Later, when the higher earner hits 70, they can collect extra-large checks.\r\n\r\nAlso, should that higher-earning spouse die first, the spouse with the smaller earnings history can collect those bigger benefit checks. Note, too, that even divorcees can collect benefits based on their ex-spouse\'s earnings history -- if they were married for at least 10 years and have not remarried.

While the new data confirms a decades-long shift in consumption habits from soda to water, largely driven by health concerns, some argue it also suggests a need to improve water infrastructure in the United States.\r\n\r\nUS bottled water sales grew from 11.8 billion gallons in 2015 to 12.8 billion gallons in 2016, BMC said. While annual per capita consumption of bottled water reached 39.3 gallons, carbonated soft drinks slipped to 38.5 gallons. That\'s a dramatic drop from the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the average American drank more than 50 gallons of soft drinks per year.\r\n\r\nFor Julie Ralston Aoki, director of Healthy Eating and Active Living at the Public Health Law Center in St. Paul, Minn., the trend is driven by health-conscious consumers.\r\n\r\n“People want to make a healthier choice,” she tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview. “I do also think that the beverage industry has been making an effort to diversify and offer a variety of products that appeal to customers, so that\'s helped too.”\r\n\r\nBottled water was a $16 billion industry in 2016, almost triple what it was in 2000, according to BMC. Within that market, domestic sparkling water sales saw the most growth between 2013 and 2015, a report from the International Bottled Water Association shows.\r\n\r\nThis consumption trend reflects a shift in the public’s acceptance of bottled water, said BMC\'s chief executive officer Michael Bellas.  \r\n\r\n“Where once it would have been unimaginable to see Americans walking down the street carrying plastic bottles of water, or driving around with them in their cars\' cup holders, now that\'s the norm,\" he said in a statement. \r\n\r\nBottled water may be the new normal, but it still costs dramatically more than drinking tap water. An industry report in 2013 said consumers were spending 300 times the cost of tap water to drink bottled water. But that cost was artificially deflated by including gallon and multi-gallon jugs, even though two-thirds of bottled water is sold in single-serve bottles, where the cost of a gallon of bottled water could be almost 2,000 times that of a gallon of tap water.\r\n\r\nWhy spend so much more to drink your water out of a bottle?\r\n\r\nConsumers are concerned about the safety of the tap water, says Ms. Aoki. After the Flint, Mich., water contamination and treatment crisis, only 1 in 3 Americans were willing to drink water straight from the tap, as the Monitor reported in March 2016.','http://www.csmonitor.com','Business','Mengqi Sun','1031329_1_0310-bottled-water_standard.jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-12 19:09:00');

Chart by author.\r\n\r\nAbbVie claims the top spot for dividend yield, but all three biotech stocks boast nice yields that many investors would find attractive.\r\n\r\nYield isn\'t the most important metric to look at in evaluating dividend stocks, however. A company that pays a high dividend today could be forced to slash its dividend tomorrow. That\'s why the next two criteria we\'ll review are even more critical.\r\n\r\nDividend history\r\nThe dividend history of a company provides clues about how important the dividend is to the company\'s management. The chart below shows the dividends paid by each of the three biotechs over the past five years. \r\n\r\n\r\nABBV Dividend data by YCharts.\r\n\r\nGilead Sciences didn\'t initiate a dividend program until 2015, so the biotech doesn\'t have much of a track record yet. AbbVie\'s history is actually better than the chart shows. The biotech was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013. When its parent company\'s dividend history is factored in, AbbVie has consistently increased its dividend for 44 consecutive years. \r\n\r\nAmgen hasn\'t been paying dividends nearly that long. However, the biotech has a solid record of increasing its dividends and has grown its dividend more quickly than any of the others. \r\n\r\nPayout ratio\r\nThe dividend payout ratio is the amount of dividends returned to shareholders as a percentage of total earnings. A lower payout ratio indicates that a company is probably in better position to continue paying dividends and perhaps even increase dividends in the future.\r\n\r\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Chart by author.\r\n\r\nGilead Sciences appears to be in best position to keep its dividend flowing based on payout ratio. All three biotechs seems to be in good shape, however. Even though AbbVie is using nearly 63% of earnings to fund its dividend program, that\'s not a bad level and definitely isn\'t cause for concern.\r\n\r\nGrowth\r\nThere is a catch with payout ratios, however. The metric is a snapshot in time based on current dividend payments and current earnings. But what if earnings decline a lot? That\'s why it\'s also important to look at earnings growth prospects.\r\n\r\nWall Street analysts spend a lot of time to create models of earnings growth for companies. Here\'s how the three biotech stocks stack up in terms of projected earnings growth.\r\n\r\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Chart by author.\r\n\r\nBased on these projections, AbbVie will grow earnings the most over the next few years. Analysts\' estimates can sometimes be far off of what really happens. For example, if AbbVie can\'t fend off biosimilar competition for Humira, the company\'s earnings will likely suffer greatly. At the opposite end of the ranking, Gilead Sciences could make a big acquisition that totally changes its earnings outlook.\r\n\r\nBest overall\r\nWhich is the best biotech dividend stock? I think the clear winner is AbbVie.\r\n\r\nAbbVie ranked No. 1 in dividend yield and projected earnings growth. Even though Amgen has increased its dividend the most in recent years, I\'d argue that AbbVie\'s overall track record is the most impressive. Also, although AbbVie\'s dividend payout ratio is the worst of the three, it\'s still pretty good.\r\n\r\nIn my view, AbbVie will likely keep its top spot for a while to come. The company should be able to use legal tactics to hold off Humira biosimilars for at least a few years. I think AbbVie\'s mouthwatering dividends will keep on flowing in the meantime. \r\n\r\n10 stocks we like better than AbbVie\r\n\r\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*\r\n\r\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and AbbVie wasn\'t one of them!

It was last at $48.49 by close of trade, down 88 cents, or about 1.8%.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. benchmark lost $4.84, or almost 9%, on the week, its biggest weekly drop in five months.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for May delivery slumped 82 cents, or about 1.6%, to settle at $51.37 a barrel by close of trade. The global benchmark fell to $51.14 earlier, its cheapest since November 30.\r\n\r\nFor the week, London-traded Brent futures recorded a loss of $4.53, or 8.1%, the fifth straight weekly decline.\r\n\r\nConcerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand pressured crude prices.\r\n\r\nData from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes on Friday revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by 8 last week, the eighth weekly increase in a row. That brought the total count to 617, the most since October 2015.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies jumped by 8.2 million barrels last week to yet another all-time high of 528.4 million. It was the ninth straight weekly build in U.S. stockpiles, feeding concerns about a global glut.\r\n\r\nOil prices have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the low-to-mid-$50s over the past three months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between rising stockpiles and increased shale production in the U.S. and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.\r\n\r\nOPEC and non-OPEC countries made a strong start to lowering their oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day by the end of June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.\r\n\r\nKuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June.\r\n\r\nElsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for April shed 2.4 cents, or about 1.5% to $1.600 on Friday. It ended down about 3.2% for the week.\r\n\r\nApril heating oil inched down 2.5 cents, or 1.7%, to finish at $1.503 a gallon, the lowest since November 30. For the week, the fuel lost roughly 5.7%.\r\n\r\nNatural gas futures for April delivery rose 3.4 cents, or almost 1.2%, to $3.008 per million British thermal units. It posted a weekly gain of 6.4%.\r\n\r\nIn the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world\'s largest oil consumer.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, investors will keep an eye out for monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to gauge global supply and demand levels.\r\n\r\nTraders will also continue to pay close attention to comments from global oil producers for further evidence that they are complying with their agreement to reduce output this year.\r\n\r\nAhead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.\r\n','http://www.nasdaq.com','Business','Shutterstock','finance30.jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-12 19:13:00');

The closings, first reported by Nation\'s Restaurant News on Thursday, left fans distraught.\r\n\r\nBut it was easy to see the move coming after Chipotle announced in October that it was halting investments in the brand. Instead, the burrito giant\'s spinoff aspirations will focus on two other endeavors: Pizzeria Locale and Tasty Made, a pizza joint and a burger place, respectively. \"We just didn\'t believe that ShopHouse warranted continued investment,\" Chris Arnold, a spokesperson for Chipotle, said in an email.\r\n\r\nShopHouse, which opened its first location in 2011 in Dupont Circle, offered customizable rice, noodle and salad bowls inspired by the cuisines of Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. It represented a glimmer of hope for diners interested in something different and at least marginally more nutritious than what was served at most fast-casual chains.\r\n\r\nBut selling Southeast Asian cuisine proved to be a losing gamble in an industry dominated by burgers and sandwiches. The top 10 quick-service and fast-casual brands, as ranked by U.S. sales in 2016\'s QSR 50, an annual list published by industry publication QSR magazine, don\'t include any restaurants serving Asian cuisine. The list is topped by the likes of McDonald\'s, Starbucks, Subway, Burger King and Taco Bell.\r\n\r\nEven when QSR broke out supposed “ethnic” brands — the label is a bit of a stretch — the results aren\'t that impressive. Taco Bell was ranked at No. 5; further down the list are Chipotle (12), Panda Express (22), Qdoba (34), Del Taco (37) and Moe\'s Southwest Grill (43). Only one Asian concept made the top 50: Panda Express, a chain perhaps best known for its fried, sticky orange chicken, which is a far cry from ShopHouse\'s grilled steak seasoned with fish sauce, or its sweet and sour tamarind vinaigrette.\r\n\r\nThose Southeast Asian flavors were unfamiliar to many Americans. Darren Tristano, president of market research firm Technomic, said that when the brand launched, he believed the biggest challenge would be getting consumers to see that Southeast Asian cuisine wasn\'t outside the norm. \"When your core focus is on that, it just makes it very, very difficult,\" he said. He points to Mexican, Italian and Chinese as the big three when it comes to popular international flavors, while Japanese and Greek make the cut to a lesser extent.\r\n\r\nIn an interview last year with The Post, ShopHouse brand director and co-founder Tim Wildin said he wanted to work with traditional Asian ingredients, noting that Thai flavors in particular had a universal appeal. He acknowledged there was a bit of a learning curve when customers complained the food was too spicy. But there wasn\'t necessarily a need to “Americanize” the food, he said, just a need to communicate better.\r\n\r\nShopHouse probably could have improved its communication in at least one other way, said Sam Oches, editorial director of Food News Media, which produces QSR magazine. He said the brand didn\'t do enough to promote itself as innovative and unique, which is ironic given the way Chipotle was able to establish a reputation as a trailblazer in the industry.\r\n\r\nShopHouse was “pretty ahead of the curve,” Oches said, adding that Asian fast-casual restaurants are now increasingly popular with millennials.\r\n\r\nIn the last five years, several have opened in Washington, including Buredo, SeoulSpice, Maki Shop and Four Sisters Grill. Had ShopHouse debuted now, or even just a few years later than it did, it would have entered a market still lacking immediate competitors but perhaps one more receptive to its food. Oches expects that 10 or 15 years from now, the top 10 quick-service brands may not look too different from today, but the rest of the list will likely include more concepts serving Asian cuisine, which are just now scaling up to compete.\r\n\r\nShopHouse may also have partially been a victim of Chipotle\'s greater struggles. Following outbreaks of food-borne illness at its restaurants, the company has seen a sharp decline in sales. From 2015 to 2016, revenue dropped more than 13 percent, to $3.9 billion, according to the company\'s most recent earnings report, released last month. The decrease in net income was staggering, from about $476 million in 2015 to around $23 million in 2016. “It\'s startling how far their fall from grace has been,” Oches said of the brand he described as once being the most bankable restaurant company in America.\r\n\r\n[A year after food safety scares, Chipotle has a new set of problems]\r\n\r\nJettisoning ShopHouse may be at least one way the burrito chain is attempting to trim the fat and refocus on its core business, especially considering that, at the time the company announced it was pulling back on ShopHouse, Chipotle chairman and chief executive Steve Ells said that the concept “was not able to attract sufficient customer loyalty and visit frequency to make it a viable growth strategy.”','https://www.washingtonpost.com','Business',' Becky Krystal','imrs.jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-12 19:14:00');

Earlier on Monday, an ET poll conducted among 15 market participants showed, the rupee may hit as high as 66, reversing any seen on April 21, 2016.

With an active currency market, arbitrage opportunities too have expanded.” \r\n\r\nThe state election results are now seen as a ringing endorsement for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who also courted criticism after his demonetisation drive that was aimed at curbing corruption and black money at the cost of short-term pain. \r\n\r\nNow, the belief is that elections will give more political space to Modi in pursuing quick reforms as the victories will also help the ruling BJP bolster its membership in the Rajya Sabha, where it currently lacks a majority. \r\n\r\nCurrency speculators are too catching up fast with an active market today giving them arbitrage opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe premium gap between overseas and local contracts on the Indian rupee have nearly doubled for short-duration forward deals. \r\n\r\nFor offshore and onshore forwards contracts lasting between one and three months, the premium gap for the INR-USD pairing rose to 6-17 paisa now from 5-9 paisa earlier, dealers said. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe premium difference helps make money for traders when spread-betters, with bullish rupee outlook, short-sell the dollar against the rupee in the domestic forwards and buy the same unit from the overseas derivative market, known as non-deliverable forwards (NDF). Many companies and hedge funds are active participants in these trades, seeking to benefit from the arbitrage opportunities presented by mega-events, such as the latest polls. \r\n\r\nThe central bank may have taken note of it as it has tweaked its intervention strategy. State-owned banks are seen cutting a “sell-buy” derivative deal after buying dollars in the domestic spot market, dealers said. RBI could not immediately reached for comments on the matter. \r\n\r\nIn a sell-buy deal, banks first sell the dollar in the first leg of forwards transaction after buying it from spot market. But, they then buy the unit in the next leg of forwards transaction keeping the net position at ‘buy’. \r\n\r\nThe approach should help narrowing arbitrages between onshore and offshore curbing any volatility,” said a head currency dealer from a mid-size bank. \r\n\r\n\r\n','http://economictimes.indiatimes.com','Business','Saikat Das','download (3).jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-14 14:46:00');

Aamir, who turned 52 on Tuesday, opened up about his film, family, future projects and a lot more to Filmfare magazine. While he was at it, the actor also opened up about being a dad to three children- Junaid, Ira and Azad.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about becoming a father to Azad, Aamir said it was a different experience as compared to his first son Junaid. Aamir said, \"Yeah, it was different. The first child gets the most attention. When it\'s your first child, you\'re nervous, you\'re extra cautious, extra involved. When Junaid was born in 1993 I shot only for 36 days that year. For 328 days I was with him. That excitement, that nervousness wasn\'t there with Ira nor with Azad. Haan theekh hai ro raha hai, roney do (Yeah, okay. He is crying let him cry). With the first child it\'s arrey roh raha hai, kya hogaya (He is crying? What happened?)\"\r\nAamir also admitted that he is not a \"hands-on father\" and gave all credit to ex-wife Reena and wife Kiran for raising the children. He said, \"Also, I\'ve to admit I\'m not someone who\'s fully there mentally most of the time. Kiran is a hands-on mother. Reena was also a hands-on mother. I was not such a hands-on father except for Junaid during that first one year.\"\r\n\r\nHe added, \"Hands-on is when you\'re sharing equal responsibilities with your partner in bringing up the child. Honestly, I\'m not sharing that. I\'m afraid I\'m a self-obsessed person. Self-obsessed means I\'m more in my work, in my own world. And I\'m more excited about the things I\'m doing, the world that I\'m in. You can give it a fancy word but the bottom line is that I\'m obsessed with my own life.\"\r\nWhen asked if he is making a conscious decision to keep his children out of the film industry, he said that he is neither trying to get them in nor keep them out. Aamir revealed that his older son is learning theatre while his daughter has begun working as an assistant director with an advertising company.','http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com','Entertainment','  ','download (4).jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-15 11:16:00');

The two actors are working for the third time after Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania and Student of The Year, and it seems that their film is on a spree of breaking box office records. Despite Holi, the film has managed to collect Rs 12.08 crores at the box office, minting a total of Rs 55.13 crores. The film’s overwhelming response brings hope for the industry after a couple of disappointing movies in the past few months including Rangoon, Commando 2 and Ok Jaanu.\r\nBadrinath Ki Dulhania has become Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan’s all-time highest opening weekend grosser as a lead pair, reported Bollywood Hungama. Their previous two films Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania and Student of The Year collected Rs 33.74 crore and 30 crore respectively in the first weekend.\r\n\r\nf we talk about Alia and Varun individually, then also the film has set new benchmarks for both the actors. Badrinath Ki Dulhania is Varun’s third highest weekend grosser after Dilwale (Rs. 64.09 crore) and ABCD – Any Body Can Dance 2 (Rs. 46.35 crore). For Alia, the film is the biggest opening weekend grosser. Her film 2 States with Rs 37.62 crore, is the only other film which comes close to Badrinath Ki Dulhania’s opening weekend collection.\r\n\r\nadrinath Ki Dulhania is also the fourth highest opening weekend grosser of 2017 after Raees (93.24 crore), Kaabil (Rs. 67.46 cr) and Jolly LLB 2 (Rs. 50.46 crore). Unlike these three films that feature superstars like Shah Rukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan and Akshay Kumar, Badrinath Ki Dulhania rides on the sheer acting chops of rather young Alia and Varun.\r\n\r\nTrade analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted, ” #BadrinathKiDulhania Fri 12.25 cr, Sat 14.75 cr, Sun 16.05 cr.

It’s difficult to imagine that until five years ago we hadn’t even heard of this Bhatt star kid, only passing mentions in the press as Mahesh Bhatt’s daughter and Pooja Bhatt’s sister. Representing the new Bollywood order, she came at a time when many established actresses (Kareena Kapoor with whom Alia shared screen in Udta Punjab and Aishwarya Rai to name a few) were approaching dead-end. The industry was suddenly flushed with bright sparks – Sonakshi Sinha, Kangana Ranaut, Anushka Sharma and the slightly older Vidya Balan, whose late flowering shook things up for Bollywood. In such a galaxy of talents, who would have expected Alia Bhatt, the youngest among her peers, to become a front-runner for best star performer? Alia, with plenty of charm and easy grip on acting, strikes you as a natural-born who has inherited all the good genes of the Bhatts.\r\n\r\nn her short career, she has been loved and trolled and mocked at equally, for reasons other than her stardom. Those who feel she isn’t as intelligent as her famous dad or sister need only watch one of her performances to know that it’s not possible to convey such emotional and intuitive power on screen without possessing intellect. The other Bhatts are just knowledgeable. She is alert, keen, frank and totally unselfconscious about her work. The few films she has been a part of reveal a great understanding that acting is all about being yourself and that’s what sets her apart from both her celebrity family and other heroines.\r\n\r\nShe opts for raw, tormented and troubled characters when she can be unashamedly eye-candy just like others. Ain’t gonna fly for Ms Bhatt. There’s a layer to her characters which the audience slowly unpeels. She has made the classic Alia Bhatt outburst and confrontational monologue her own. She seems to relish challenging authority, both on and off-screen. Mostly, directors appear to be fond of giving this baby-faced ingénue, a back story of traumatic childhood or some parenting issue to arrive at a coming-of-age. If Ranbir Kapoor is the male epitome of Bollywood’s coming-of-age, Alia is its female ambassador.\r\nOn her birthday today, we pick five of her top performances. Bear in mind that she debuted in 2012 and has neither the prolific body of work nor the wisdom of her colleagues.\r\n\r\nDear Zindagi\r\nhe ease with which Alia slips into Kiara, a young urban girl whose existential problems are not unfamiliar to those of us who live in the Big City, you are tempted to wonder if this is a character that’s closest to Alia, the person. She is commitment phobic. She desires a guy who has rebuffed her. She has had a difficult childhood (an Alia speciality). Ugly family secrets and skeletons will tumble out, much like her other film, Kapoor & Sons. In walks the magically charming, Shah Rukh Khan. He’s the shrink and she, the patient. The distinction will blur. How can a girl not fall for the impish charms of SRK? How can a guy not fall for the frank sexuality and peppy school-girlish appeal of Alia Bhatt?\r\n\r\nUdta Punjab\r\nA truly ensemble film, with brilliant performances by Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan and the heart-warmingly understated Diljit Dosanjh. But, some of Udta Punjab’s most haunting moments involve Alia Bhatt. She picks up the Bihari accent like she went to school with Lalu Prasad Yadav. She plays a migrant who works on a farm where she finds a bag of heroin. In an attempt to sell it, she gets sucked into a vicious underbelly. She is raped repeatedly. All she wants, this girl who had dreams of being a hockey player, is a better life – a normal life. Her ‘achcha tayme’ outburst is one of the highlights of the film. Note: She was also equally riveting in Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania where she gets to play a massy heroine.\r\n\r\nKapoor & Sons\r\nOnce again, Alia’s character has a troubled childhood. She lost her parents young and now lives alone. But she can’t even begin to fathom the darkest of secrets that will fall out of the Kapoor and Sons family when she meets one of the two Kapoor brothers at a party. “Kar Gayi Chull” became a party anthem and the film, a quintessential dysfunctional Hindi family drama of late. The film isn’t afraid to raise ugly questions about that much-revered unit in Indian society – family. And, Alia, who is the most sorted character in this Wes Anderson-esque family, tops the charts with her affecting and economical performance.\r\n\r\nHighway\r\nHer first breakout performance (though she was refreshing in her debut, Student of the Year), Imtiaz Ali’s Highway happened early in her career. It set the stage for what was to come – Alia would alternate between wildly commercial films where she is popcorn fresh and daringly offbeat ones which would employ all her dramatic talents. The film is about escape, freedom, utopia/dystopia, bondage, parenting and coming-of-age – all the themes that define the on-screen Alia. She gets to play not only a role but also live it. This high society Delhi girl is out on the road and like any young girl, her emotions run the entire gamut – she’s vulnerable, raw, strong, innocent, independent and explosive.\r\n\r\n','http://indianexpress.com','Entertainment','Shaikh Ayaz','images (3).jpg',?,0,NULL,1,'2017-03-15 11:29:00');
